\title{Example dataset containing bulk ATAC-Seq data from five PBMC samples.}
\format{
This is a list of 2 elements: \describe{
 \item{$counts}{(matrix of 106446 genes x 5 donors) The raw counts were normalized
 using a TPM-like approach, i.e., normalizing the counts by the length of the open regions
 and by the total number of counts in each sample. The open regions have been determined
 using the MACS2 peak calling tool within the PEPATAC framework and the \emph{hg38} genome
 was considered.}
 \item{$cellFractions.obs}{(matrix of 5 donors x 9 cell types) The
   proportions of the different cell types measured by flow cytometry.}}

\description{
This is the dataset measured in \href{https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/94833#s1}{
 \cite{Gabriel et al., 2024}}. It contains
the ATAC-Seq data from 5 healthy PBMC samples as well as the proportions of the
the immune cell types as measured by flow cytometry.
