Description: Package implementing EPIC method to estimate the proportion of
    immune, stromal, endothelial and cancer or other cells from bulk chromatin accessibility or gene
    expression data.
    It is based on reference profiles for the main non-malignant
    cell types and it predicts the proportion of these cells and of the
    remaining "other cells" (that are mostly cancer cells) for which no
    reference profile is given.
